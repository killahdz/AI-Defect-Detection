## üéØ Purpose

Developed to support high-accuracy AI defect detection in timber processing and manufacturing, this toolkit is suitable for any object detection task requiring:

- Model training with configurable augmentation
- Evaluation with bounding box matching and heatmap visualization
- Conversion and export of models (PyTorch ‚Üí ONNX)
- Real-time overlay and diagnostics using OpenCV and Matplotlib

---

## üöÄ Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/killahdz/AI-Defect-Detection.git
   cd AI-Defect-Detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install ultralytics opencv-python matplotlib numpy scipy seaborn pyyaml torch
   ```

3. **Prepare your dataset** (see below).

4. **Train a model**:
   ```sh
   python train_yolov8.py --data dataset.yaml --model yolov8m.pt --img 1280 --epochs 100
   ```

5. **Evaluate your trained model**:
   ```sh
   python eval_yolov8.py --weights wood_defect_runs/best.pt --data dataset.yaml
   ```

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Included

### ‚úÖ Training Scripts

Custom YOLOv8 training routines with advanced configuration:

- Supports multiple model sizes (`n`, `s`, `m`, `l`, `x`)
- Augmentation for color, brightness, mosaic, and rotation
- Automatic saving of models to `.pt` and `.onnx`
- GPU auto-detection and AMP support
- Optional validation + visualization of results
- Configurable dataset format (Kaggle-style or Dataset Ninja)

### ‚úÖ Evaluation Scripts

Interactive tools for inference and metrics:

- Live prediction with YOLOv8 checkpoints
- Bounding box matching via **Hungarian Algorithm**
- Per-class **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** tracking
- Heatmap generation of class-wise performance over time
- Non-Max Suppression and annotation validation logic

## üìÇ Directory Layout

| Path                         | Description                                    |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `train_yolov8.py`            | Training script for YOLOv8                     |
| `eval_yolov8.py`             | Evaluation and visualization script            |
| `utils.py`                   | Utility functions (augmentation, metrics, etc) |
| `models/*.pt` / `*.onnx`     | Trained model weights (YOLOv8 + exported ONNX) |
| `dataset.yaml`               | Dataset configuration for YOLOv8 training      |
| `train/images`               | Training images                                |
| `train/labels`               | YOLO-format label files                        |
| `wood_defect_runs/`          | Output directory for model checkpoints/plots   |

## üìë Dataset Format

- Images are stored in `train/images/`
- Labels (YOLO format) in `train/labels/`
- `dataset.yaml` example:
  ```yaml
  train: ./train/images
  val: ./val/images
  nc: 4  # number of classes
  names: ['knot', 'crack', 'hole', 'discoloration']
  ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Variants (YOLOv8)

| Model         | Parameters | Use Case                              |
|---------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| `yolov8n.pt`  | ~3M        | Lightweight (Jetson, edge inference)   |
| `yolov8s.pt`  | ~11M       | Balanced (fast + accurate)             |
| `yolov8m.pt`  | ~25M       | Higher accuracy, mid-range GPU         |
| `yolov8l.pt`  | ~43M       | High accuracy, heavy GPU (A100 etc.)   |
| `yolov8x.pt`  | ~68M       | Maximum accuracy, slowest              |

**Recommended:** `yolov8m.pt` with 1280√ó1280 or `yolov8s.pt` with 960√ó960 for balanced speed and accuracy.
